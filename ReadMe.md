# IoT Worksheet 1 

This file will explain how the Shooting game that I have created for the Micro:bit works.
It was developed using the Micro:bit Python Editor.


## How the game works
It is a shooter game in which the player, represented by a pixel at the bottom of the LED tries to shoot and destroy the enemy, represented by a pixel at the top of the screen. 
The enemy spawns at random locations at the top of the LED screen.
The player shoots when the button 'A' is pressed and the player moves according to how much you tilt the Micro:bit, which makes use of the accelerometer built into it.
When the bullet hits the enemy it will be destroyed and will spawn another enemy at a random spot.
If the player misses enemy four times then it a game over screen and your score will be shown.
If the player destroys the enemy 4 times then a 'CONGRATS' message along with your score will appear.
